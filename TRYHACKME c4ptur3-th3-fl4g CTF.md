 TryHackMe CTF Challenge Write-up: Strengthening Cybersecurity Skills  

Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field that demands hands-on experience and a problem-solving mindset. Recently, I took on a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on TryHackMe, focusing on different aspects of security analysis, encryption, and data extraction. These exercises tested my ability to think critically, analyze vulnerabilities, and uncover hidden data, reinforcing my skills in Threat Hunting, Digital Forensics, and Security Analysis.  

 Challenge Overview  
📌 Platform: TryHackMe  
📌 Category: Cryptography, Steganography  
📌 Difficulty Level: Beginner to Intermediate  
📌 Objective: Solve security challenges using a combination of technical expertise and analytical thinking.  

 Breakdown of the Tasks  

 🔐 Task 1: Translation & Shifting  
The challenge involved deciphering encoded messages using shifting and transliteration techniques. I explored various encoding methods, including Caesar cipher, ROT13, Base64, and Hex encoding, to unveil the hidden message. This task highlighted the importance of understanding cryptographic principles and their real-world applications.

ANS : Let's make this a bit trickier...

 



 🎧 Task 2: Spectrograms  
 
This was one of the most intriguing challenges! By analyzing an audio spectrogram, I extracted hidden information embedded within sound waves. Using tools like Sonic Visualizer and Audacity, I visualized the frequency patterns and successfully retrieved the embedded message. This exercise reinforced the concept of data hiding in multimedia files, a technique often exploited in steganography and forensic investigations.  

- Download the file
  ANS : Super Secret Message


 🕵️‍♂️ Task 3: Steganography  
 
Steganography is the art of concealing information within digital media. This task required me to uncover hidden messages within image files. I leveraged tools like StegHide, Binwalk, and zsteg to extract concealed text from images. The challenge emphasized how adversaries can embed malicious data within seemingly harmless files and how cybersecurity professionals can detect such threats.  

- Decode the image to reveal the answer.
  ANS : SpaghettiSteg

 🔒 Task 4: Security Through Obscurity  
 
This task debunked the myth that obscurity alone can secure data. By analyzing hidden directories, misconfigured permissions, and encoded data, I demonstrated why relying solely on security-by-obscurity is not a robust defense strategy. Implementing layered security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and proper system configurations, is essential for ensuring a strong security posture.  

- Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
  ANS : hackerchat.png

- Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
  ANS : AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!


 Key Takeaways  
✅ Hands-on experience with real-world cybersecurity techniques  
✅ Developed stronger analytical and problem-solving skills  
✅ Enhanced my understanding of cryptographic principles, steganography, and OSINT  
✅ Reinforced the importance of layered security over security-by-obscurity  

 Final Thoughts  
Participating in CTF challenges like these has been an exciting way to apply cybersecurity concepts in a practical setting. These exercises not only improved my problem-solving skills but also deepened my understanding of potential security threats. As I continue exploring cybersecurity challenges, I aim to leverage these skills in Threat Hunting, Security Automation, and Digital Forensics.
