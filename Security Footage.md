 A Tale of Packets and Pixels: Recovering Security Footage from Thin Air

 💥 The Incident

Our office was broken into. Clean job. Except for one thing: they destroyed the hard drives that contained all the security footage. No DVR. No cloud. Nothing.

Except a `.pcap` file.

Someone had the foresight to capture the network traffic from the surveillance subnet. That was all I had to work with.

A single file:

```
security-footage-1648933966395.pcap
```

And a single shot at the truth.

 🔍 Step One: Dive Into the Packets

Like any digital forensics geek, I started with Wireshark. Loaded the `.pcap`, filtered for HTTP, and scrolled through the payloads.

Nothing too juicy at first glance. But then I saw it.

```
Content-Type: image/jpeg
```

JPEGs... over HTTP? That’s when it clicked.

This was likely an MJPEG stream — a common format used by IP cameras where each frame is a separate JPEG image. The camera doesn’t send a video — it sends hundreds of JPEGs in rapid sequence.

So instead of looking for a video file, I needed to reconstruct the stream, image by image.

 🧪 The (Almost) Wrong Turn

At first, I thought:

> "Why not extract the HTTP payloads manually, dump the binary, and convert them into images?"

I almost started using `xxd` or `hexdump` to grab the binary payloads, one by one, and reconstruct the JPEGs manually.

That would've taken forever.

 🧰 Enter: `foremost`

Then I remembered a tool from the digital forensics underworld: `foremost`.

Originally designed for law enforcement to carve deleted files from disk images, `foremost` works just as well on PCAPs.

 🔧 What is `foremost`?

 A file carving tool
 Searches for known file headers/footers in raw binary data
 Extracts files like JPEG, PNG, ZIP, DOC, and more

 ✅ How I Used It

```
foremost -i security-footage-1648933966395.pcap -o extracted/
```

This told `foremost`:

 `-i`: Input file is the `.pcap`
 `-o`: Output the recovered files into a folder

After a short wait, it carved out a treasure trove of images from the stream:

```
extracted/jpeg/
```

 🎞️ Reconstructing the Footage

Hundreds of frames. No context. No timestamps. Just raw, silent images.

But here’s a trick:

 ⏩ Bash Image Flipbook

```
for img in .jpg; do feh "$img"; sleep 0.1; done
```

This flipped through each frame with a short delay. Suddenly, it felt like I was watching the footage in real-time.

But something felt off…

---

 🔡 The Flag Was Fragmented

There wasn’t a single frame containing the full flag. Instead, each image had a tiny fragment — a single character, sometimes two — subtly embedded.

It wasn’t just a visual sequence; it was a puzzle, with each JPEG carrying part of the final message.

Even more clever? Every image had a serial code — a hint to the correct order.

It became clear: the flag had to be reassembled manually, piece by piece.

So I wrote a script to extract and sort the characters based on their serial tags — and finally, the full flag appeared:

```
flag{5ebf457ea66}
```

Pixel by pixel. Image by image. The truth came back.

 🔬 Tool Breakdown

Here’s a quick rundown of everything I used:

 🧠 Wireshark

 Opened the `.pcap`
 Inspected packet details
 Verified presence of `image/jpeg` payloads

 🔧 foremost

 Carved JPEG images out of raw packet data
 Saved them to a structured output directory

 🖼️ feh

 Lightweight image viewer
 Used to animate JPEGs like a flipbook

 🐚 bash

 Wrote a simple `for` loop to display images
 Scripted frame processing and character sorting

 🧵 Custom script (Python)

 Parsed serial codes
 Reconstructed the full flag from individual pieces

---

 🎯 Final Thoughts

This wasn’t just about extracting images. It was about understanding how devices communicate, how cameras stream, and how even when evidence is "destroyed," it’s never really gone.

Next time someone tries to wipe the truth...
